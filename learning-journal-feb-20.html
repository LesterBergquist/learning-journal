        <h1>Loops and Operators</h1>        
        <script>document.write('<You can use these operatorsto compare values and script:</h3>');
        </script>
        <p> aa=='2' will return true</p>
        <p>aa ==='2' will return false</p>
        <p> aa !== will return false</p>



        <h1>LOgical operators</h1> 
        <p> lOgical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.</p>
        <p>((5 < 2) && (2 >= 3))</p>
        <p> The expression on the left returns false and so does the expression on the right.</p>
        <p>The third expression uses a logical operator to see whether both expressions on either side return true.</p>
        <p> In this case they do not, so it evaluates to false.</p>
        <p>Logical and: &&  Logical or ||  Logical not !</p>

        <h1>Loops</h1>  
        <p> oops are conditionals. If the condition is met, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked</p>
        <p>and if it still returns true, the code block will run again, repeating until the condition is not met (is false).</p>
        <p>The 3 common types of loops are:
            <ul>
                <li> "for loops"</li>
                <li> "while loops"</li>
                <li> "do while loops"</li>

        <p> a 'for' loop uses a counter as a condition.</p>
         <p>A while loop returns loops for as long as a condition is true.</p>
         <p> The do...while loop is similar to the while loop but will always run the statement inside the</p>
         <p> curly brackets once, even if the condition evaluates to false.</p>

## Hello! My name is Lester. 


###
### The growth mindset, to me, is about meta-learning, learning how we learn.
### The myth is that you're born knowing.
### The truth is that it's a habit that is built.
Reading Steve Haffenden's piece on **the growth mindset**, I found I sympathized with his relationship to the *snooze* button.

### Three things I need to keep myself from giving up:
### 1 humility
### 2 grit
### 3 help

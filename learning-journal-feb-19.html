        <h1>Expressions and Operators</h1> 
        <p> In order for a variable to be useful it needs to be assigned a value.</p>
        <p>you can perform operations on the values to determine a single value.</p>
        <p> OPerators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values</p>
        <p>There are assignment operators, arithmetic operators and string operators.</p>
        <p> The order of execution is the same as in mathematics; so, multiplication before addition for instance.</p>
        <p>The string operator '+' joins strings on either side of it.</p>

        <h1>Functions</h1>  
        <p> Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.</p>
        <p>You can simply repeat the function rather than repeating all the statements that make it up.</p>

Git is a DVCS, a version control system that allows clients to create mirrored repositories – collaboration with more than one simultaneous workflow

Git tracks changes, prevents loss.

Three steps modified, staged, commit

git config is a command that contros the aspect of a file – how it looks

To import an existing project, change directory: cd test
Git init
Start tracking by peforming commit:
 Git add *.d
Git add LICENSE
Git commit –m “message”
To clone: git clone (url)
Local repository structure – working directory (actual file here), index (area for staging) , head (most recent commit)

Git add filename 
Git commit –m “message”
Git push origin master

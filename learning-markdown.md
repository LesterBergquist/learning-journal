learning markdown assignment (not pretty, but done!)


Markdown is a way to style text on the web. It is mostly done with a few characters, like # or *.  


You can use it to bold, italicize, link, make ordered and unordered lists, and more.
Basically Markdown is an easy way to shape your text on the web.

You can use Markdown to write on GitHub.

GitHub pages are an easy way to create a webpage. In many cases you don’t even need to use html.

You use GitHub to create a repository. A repository is what we call a place to put your text
Here’s how to do it: Head to GitHub and create a new repository named *username*.github.io, where *username* is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.
If you want to build something a bit more ambitious like a blog or a structured documentation, GitHub Pages can help you streamline your publishing experience.


GitHub frees you up to focus on the content of your site, instead of putting a lot of energy into shaping the content.
Go to (Github pages) [https://pages.github.com/] and follow the instructions there.

Once it’s up and running, you can visit and bookmark the (GitHub Markdown Syntax page) [https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax] to see how to do basic writing and formatting. A few examples:

Use **two stars** on either side of text to bold it.
Use *one star* to italicize it.
To strikethrough text, just surround it with ~~two tildes~~
You can quote text with a > , like this:


As Frank Herbert said:
>	I prefer the movie to the book  


Or create a link by wrapping link text in brackets, like so:
This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

There’s plenty there to play with, so get started!

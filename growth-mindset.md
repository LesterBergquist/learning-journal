Markdown is a way to style text on the web. It is mostly done with a few non-alphabet characters, like # or * .

You can use it to bold text, italicize it, make ordered and unordered lists, quote text, link and more.

You can use Markdwn to write on GitHub.

GitHub pages are easy to create using Markdown. In many cases you don't even need to use html.
